AIM: When establishing a remote connection between a client and a server, a primary concern is ensuring security. For Linux users,
     the best practice of accessing and managing your server remotely is through the cryptographic protocol known as Secure Shell (SSH).
     The ssh command provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network.
     This connection can also be used for terminal access, file transfers, and for tunneling other applications.
 
 Commands:

//To install SSH, first update the package repository cache with//

} #sudo apt-get update

//To install the OpenSSH software package //

 } #sudo apt-get -y install openssh-server

 //To enable SSH//

 }#sudo systemctl enable ssh
 
// (optional)-if required change the configurations from the sshd config file //
 
 }#sudo systemctl start ssh
 
 }(optional) #sudo systemctl status ssh
 
 }#sudo ssh localhost
 
// Then enter your root or user password whatever it may be//
