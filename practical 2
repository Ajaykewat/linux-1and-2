useradd creates a new user account according to the options specified on the command line and the default values set in the /etc/default/useradd file.

sudo systemctl status – shows status of all services on server
sudo systemctl status apache2 – shows status of specific service
sudo systemctl start/restart/stop apache2 – start/stop restart service
Service

sudo service —status-all | less – shows status of services and allows you to scroll through results.
sudo service apache2 status/start/stop/restart – to manage services

Static IP Address in Debian / Ubuntu
To setup static IP address in Debian/ Ubuntu, open the following file:

# nano /etc/network/interfaces
You may see a line looking like this:
To setup static IP address in Debian
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
Change it so it looks like this:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static 
  address 192.168.0.100
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  dns-nameservers 4.4.4.4
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
Save the file and then edit /etc/resolv.conf like this:

# nano /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8 # Replace with your nameserver ip
nameserver 4.4.4.4 # Replace with your nameserver ip
