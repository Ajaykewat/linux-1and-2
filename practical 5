Samba server
A Samba file server enables file sharing across different operating systems over a network. It lets you access your desktop files from a laptop and share files with Windows and macOS users. 
Step1: Installtion of  samba
sudo apt update s
sudo apt install samba
Command to  check whether it is installed:

whereis samba 

Step2: configure  samba server
mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/
The command above creates a new folder sambashare in our home directory which we will share later.
The configuration file for Samba is located at 
/etc/samba/smb.conf 
To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:
[sambashare] 
comment = Samba on Ubuntu 
path = /home/username/sambashare
read only = no 
browsable = yes
Step 3: Access Samba shared files
Now we need to access what we’ve shared. We can use the smbclient utility to access Windows shared files. We can list the shared files like this:
$ smbclient -L localhost -U%  
Step 4: Creating Samba users
To create a samba entry for an existing system user, use the pdbedit command:
$ pdbedit -a kali
The new user will be created in the Samba default user database which is /var/lib/samba/private/passdb.tdb file.
With a Samba user created, we can make the shares available only to authenticated users,
This user can access his resources on Samba server using smbclient like this:
$ smbclient -U kali -L //192.168.1.3
Restart now
$sudo systemctl restart smbd
$sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.3/24 to any samba
Adding rule
Sudo ufw reload
